In this example, I know all of the due dates for the tasks in the list, but it is okay if you do not add a due date right away. You can add the due date that you know, and then add other due dates later for these items. That way you're able to create the full list of to-do list tasks without having to wait for all of the information like those due dates to get a clear picture of Thing that needs to get done to complete the tasks in the one plan to-do lists As you enter tasks due dates, the final due date of the entire to do list project will become the latest due date of the task that has a due date.

"body" : "The scheduling mode (also called task type) is a mathematical formula used by the OnePlan work plan to automate scheduling as you build and adjust your work plan. The scheduling mode calculation uses three task values: Duration : How long the task will take. Measured in days by default. Effort : How many total hours are estimated to do the task. Default effort is 8 hours Effort = 1 day Duration. Units : The percent a resource is allocated to a task. Default 100% allocation of one resource = 8 hours Effort, or 1 day Duration. Duration, Effort, and Units are all based on the calendar applied to a given task. The default calendar is set to 1 day = 8 hours = 100% allocation for 1 day, with a 40 hour work week. However, you can apply custom calendars which can change these values, and thus change the Duration, Effort, and Units calculations in the work planner. The scheduling mode defines which task properties are fixed (provided by user) and which ones should be calculated. You may set the scheduling mode at the plan level, which will set the default for each new task in your plan, or change individual tasks as needed. There is also an Effort Driven setting that fixes the task effort value. When set, it tells the event to preserve its effort value and recalculate the other properties. At the plan level, scheduling mode is referred to as the Task Type . See How do I add the Default Task Type field? to add the Default Task Type field to your OnePlan group. When you set the scheduling mode \/ task type at the plan level, all new tasks added to the plan will automatically be set to the selected scheduling mode \/ task type.

"body" : "[video] This article explains the basics of saving baselines of your work plan in OnePlan. Video Length - 1:46 Now that you have worked with your team and stakeholders to create an agree on the Project's schedule. It's time to start executing the plan before you start tracking actual progress against the plan a common best practice is to save a baseline of the original plan. A baseline is a snapshot of the original project schedule based on the initial understanding of how the project will be delivered by the project team. The reason it's important is because it's like a handshake between the project manager team and stakeholders. Once you have a baseline in place. You can determine how well the project is performing versus the original plan. Out of the box, OnePlan saves the following five fields for each task to the baseline: % Done : % Done tracks percent complete. Remember the percent done in an original baseline should be zero percent because no actual progress is tracked at this point in the schedule. Start Date Finish Date Effort : Effort is typically measured in the estimated hours needed to complete the task. Remaining Effort : Remaining effort is how many hours are left once work starts on the tasks. Because there should be no associated actuals when an initial baseline is saved, remaining effort should equal the estimated effort. That way, you can track your actual progress against the original plan to determine how the project is performing at the task level as well as overall project performance. To save a baseline of your entire project schedule (or all of the tasks in the schedule), See Save a Baseline for All Tasks for instructions and more information. To save a baseline of a few selected tasks, see Save a Baseline for Selected Tasks for instructions and more information. " },

The other baselines are important because they are then used for historical purposes to compare the project performance against the current Baseline. Click Save . You will be asked if you want to save the current Baseline. Click, Yes , and then OnePlan saves the Baseline. We also recommend saving an additional baseline (Baseline (1) in this example). Baseline (1) now becomes something that you can save for historical purposes. Additional baselines give you that history that you'll be able to save, should you encounter situation where you need to rebaseline and then at that point you would use Baseline (0) to be the baseline for taking another snapshot of your schedule.

When you create a version of your work plan, the work plan structure, resources, tasks, and task data are saved.

The Check Schedule feature in the OnePlan work planner runs backend checks with the database to ensure your schedule data's integrity. A scenario when you would want to use the Check Schedule button is after you import a work plan template into your work plan. Check Schedule will check your schedule and repair any errors that could occur when importing a template - such as date errors. You may also want to run Check Schedule on your schedule when you bring data into OnePlan via an integration. Again, Check Schedule will check your data and repair errors. To run a schedule check: Click on the grid options menu. Then select Check Schedule . The schedule check will run. Once it is complete, click Ok in the Check popup that appears. Save your work plan to save any adjustments made during the check. " },

"body" : "Here we see Cost Types. Cost types allow organizations to calculate, evaluate and monitor how resources are being allocated. There are possible (and often likely) differences between how our resources’ time is initially planned, booked onto specific work, and then actually spent. The Resource Plan allows multiple cost types so you may analyze the differences. You can toggle from one cost type to another. The reason these groupings are called “cost” types is because the resource plan hours may be converted to costs when they are imported into the financial plan. The rate for each resource, according to their role or other cost category factor would be multiplied by the number of hours to get the financial value of that resource’s time. Your organization may have similar or different cost types depending on business use cases and configuration. Here are some example use cases that may apply. The Committed Hours cost type would be the initial plan generally estimated at a high level. This is also referred to as top-down planning. The Scheduled Hours cost type would be the totals from the detailed task schedule. You could import the task schedule hours into this resource plan cost type.

"body" : "This article explains how the Resource Manager pre-filter works for users set as resource managers in OnePlan admin. Resource managers are off by default. To set up resource managers, see How do I set Resource Managers?. The resource manager pre-filter is a server-side filter that loads resources into the Resource Plan area and\/or Resource Center area based on user permissions and Resource Managers admin settings. Owners and Managers Users with Owner or Manager permissions can view all resources in their OnePlan group, and can use the pre-filter to narrow down the list of resources in the Resource Plan area. The pre-filter is based on the Method set in the Resource Managers settings. For example, Owners or Managers who are set as resource managers using a Business Unit method, the users will see a Business Unit filter in the Resource Plan area. Contributors Users with Contributor permissions do not have access to other resources in their group. However, as a resource manager, Contributors can see the resources they manage in the Resource Plan area and Resource Center area. For example, if a Contributor is designated as a resource manager for IT, they will be able to view all of the IT resources in the Resource Plan area and Resource Center area.

"body" : "[video] This article explains resource cost types used in the OnePlan Resource Planner. Select the Cost Types drop down menu to toggle to another cost type. Cost types allow organizations to calculate, evaluate and monitor how resources are being allocated. There are possible (and often likely) differences between how our resources’ time is initially planned, booked onto specific work, and then actually spent. The Resource Plan allows multiple cost types so you may analyze the differences. You can toggle from one cost type to another. The reason these groupings are called “cost” types is because the resource plan hours may be converted to costs when they are imported into the financial plan. The rate for each resource, according to their role or other cost category factor would be multiplied by the number of hours to get the financial value of that resource’s time. Your organization may have similar or different cost types depending on business use cases and configuration. See Cost Type Settings to configure custom cost types. Here are some example use cases that may apply. Committed Hours would be the initial plan generally estimated at a high level. This is also referred to as top-down planning. Scheduled Hours cost type would be the totals from the detailed task schedule. You could import the task schedule hours into this resource plan cost type. Timesheet Hours cost type would be the time spent on this plan. You could import the timesheet hours into this resource plan cost type.

You can toggle from one cost type to another. A cost type may be editable or not. If not, the data is likely being imported from another financial system for reference. Your organization may have similar or different cost types depending on business use cases and configuration. Here are some common general uses that may apply. A Budget is the initial plan for what is estimated to be spent on this initiative. Expected costs are entered into cost categories. A cost category is how costs or gains are broken out into smaller defined categories. These are often organized as whether they are labor costs, and also whether they fall into expense type buckets, such as capital or operational expenses. Once the Budget gets approved and a plan moves forward in the process, The Forecast costs are often used as the ongoing expected or estimated costs, updated as the plan or initiative continues. The forecast costs can be entered manually, or copied from another cost type, such as Budget. Then, updated as needed. The Actuals cost type shows what has already been spent on the plan. Another common example of a cost type is Benefits. This is where you would track what is expected to be gained from this plan. Notice the cost categories would be different in terms of what is gained vs another cost type for financials spent. " },

NOTE: The Cost Types page shows on both the Financial Plan & Resource Plan settings pages, regardless whether some cost types are only for financial or resource planning (or both). What are Cost Types? Cost types allow organizations to calculate, evaluate and monitor what financial costs are planned, actually spent, and also financial gains. Your organization may have similar or different cost types depending on business use cases and configuration. Here are some common general uses that may apply, for reference. A Budget is the initial plan for what is estimated to be spent on this initiative. Expected costs are entered into cost categories. A cost category is how costs or gains are broken out into smaller defined categories. These are often organized as whether they are labor costs, and also whether they fall into expense type buckets, such as capital or operational expenses. Once the Budget gets approved and a plan moves forward in the process, The Forecast costs are often used as the ongoing expected or estimated costs, updated as the plan or initiative continues. The forecast costs can be entered manually, or copied from another cost type, such as Budget. Then, updated as needed. The Actuals cost type shows what has already been spent on the plan. Another common example of a cost type is Benefits. This is where you would track what is expected to be gained from this plan. Notice the cost categories would be different in terms of what is gained vs another cost type for financial spend. " },

"body" : "On the Resource Plan settings page, expand the Types topic heading. The Cost Types page shows on both the Financial Plan and Resource Plan settings pages, regardless whether some cost types are only for financial or resource planning (or both). Cost types allow organizations to calculate, evaluate and monitor how resources are being allocated. There are possible (and often likely) differences between how your resources’ time is initially planned, booked onto specific work, and then actually spent. The Resource Plan allows multiple cost types so organizations may analyze the differences. When multiple cost types are built, users can toggle from one cost type to another. The reason these groupings are called “cost” types is because the resource plan hours may be converted to costs when they are imported into the financial plan. The rate for each resource, according to their role or other cost category factor would be multiplied by the number of hours to get the financial value of that resource’s time. Your organization may have similar or different cost types depending on business use cases and configuration. Here are some example use cases that may apply, for reference. The Committed Hours cost types would be the initial plan generally estimated at a high level. This is also referred to as top-down planning. The Scheduled Hours cost type would be the totals from the detailed work\/tasks schedule. You could import the task schedule hours into this resource plan cost type. The Actual Hours cost type would be the time spent on this plan. You could import the timesheet hours into this resource plan cost type. " },

It does not map Timesheet Hours (OnePlan) to Actual Hours (Project). This is because the integration only supports mapping either % Complete or Actual Hours in Project Professional. Not both at the same time. If users want to map timesheet hours, our product recommendation is to map Timesheet Hours (OnePlan) to a custom field in Project Professional, in place of Actual Hours . Alternatively, users can remove the % Complete field in Project, and add in the Actual Hours field. Then they can map Timesheet Hours (OnePlan) to Actual Hours (Project). " },

"body" : "On the Resource Plan settings page, expand the Types topic heading. The Cost Types page shows on both the Financial Plan and Resource Plan settings pages, regardless whether some cost types are only for financial or resource planning (or both). Cost types allow organizations to calculate, evaluate and monitor how resources are being allocated. There are possible (and often likely) differences between how your resources’ time is initially planned, booked onto specific work, and then actually spent. The Resource Plan allows multiple cost types so organizations may analyze the differences. When multiple cost types are built, users can toggle from one cost type to another. The reason these groupings are called “cost” types is because the resource plan hours may be converted to costs when they are imported into the financial plan. The rate for each resource, according to their role or other cost category factor would be multiplied by the number of hours to get the financial value of that resource’s time. Your organization may have similar or different cost types depending on business use cases and configuration. Here are some example use cases that may apply, for reference. The Committed Hours cost types would be the initial plan generally estimated at a high level. This is also referred to as top-down planning. The Scheduled Hours cost type would be the totals from the detailed work\/tasks schedule. You could import the task schedule hours into this resource plan cost type. The Actual Hours cost type would be the time spent on this plan. You could import the timesheet hours into this resource plan cost type. " },

Available Apps : Select whether the cost type should show in the Financial Plan, Resource Plan, or both. Import From: Select the source for import, if applicable. Options include: None Resource Planner ( [Cost Type]) : Allows users to import from one resource plan type to another (for example, scheduled, to committed).
